# PVT-Aware Sizing using INSIGHT

Target Key innovations:
1. Few-Shot Learning to transfer INSIGHT Nominal (Base Model) to PVT corners
2. Leveraging nominal corner circuit physics and trajectory knowledge as a low-fidelity representation for intelligent targeted sampling in the high-fidelity PVT corners
(Intelligent Sampling) 
3. Attention-based RL using the learnt attention numbers in the Ensemble Models (across PVT) for much better efficiency instead of trial-and-error at the start
